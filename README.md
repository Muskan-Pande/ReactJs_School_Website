#Prerequisites
Before you begin, make sure you have the following software and accounts:

1. Node.js: Download and install the latest stable version of Node.js from nodejs.org.
2. npm (Node Package Manager): npm is included with Node.js, so installing Node.js will also install npm.
3. Git: Download and install Git from git-scm.com.

#Project Setup
1. Clone the Repository:

Open a terminal or command prompt.
Navigate to the directory where you want to clone the project.
Clone the repository using the command like: https://github.com/yourusername/school-website.git
Change to the project directory: cd school-website

2.Install Dependencies:

Ensure you are in the project directory.
Install the project dependencies using npm: npm install
This command reads the package.json file and installs all the dependencies listed under dependencies.

#Running the Project
Start the Development Server:
Ensure you are in the project directory.
Run the development server using npm: npm start
This command starts the React development server.
Once the server starts, it will automatically open the application in your default web browser. If it doesn't, manually open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000.

If you encounter any errors, refer to the logs provided by npm for detailed information about the error. The logs can be found in the npm cache directory, typically located at C:\Users\YourUsername\AppData\Local\npm-cache\_logs on Windows.
